*qtest* is an inline test extraction project, originally
developed internally for http://batteries.forge.ocamlcore.org/[the OCaml Batteries Included library] under the
name *qtest*.
It relies on http://ounit.forge.ocamlcore.org/[oUnit] as a testing framework,
though users need not know anything about it for basic usage;
it also relies on https://github.com/c-cube/qcheck[Qcheck] for random testing.

NOTE: *qtest* stands for _Quick Testing_.


* qtest is available for installation as an http://opam.ocaml.org/packages/qtest/qtest.2.2/[OPAM package].

* It has extensive documentation: see section "<<introduction>>" to get started.

* It has good syntax highlighting for Kate (KatePart: KWrite, KDevelop, Konqueror,...)
and basic support for Emacs. See the https://github.com/vincent-hugot/qtest/tree/master/editor_support[editor_support] directory


*Manual installation:*

    ./configure
    make build install

To use a custom installation prefix, use

    ./configure --prefix <path>

*Future works:*

There are ideas floating around on how to improve qtest2, generally revolving
around going from a test "extraction" to an "annotation" model.
No timetable is set yet, as all parties involved are busy bees, 
and qtest2 currently covers most of the needs of the Batteries project
and others.


*History of the project:*

(or at least, what I (VH) can unearth of it thanks to git logs)

 * 2007--2008  : Ilmari Heikkinen writes _make_suite.rb_ for his Prelude.ml.
 * Jan 17, 2011: _make_suite.rb_ is copied into Batteries. (=qtest0)
 * Jan 27, 2011: Kaustuv Chaudhuri writes from scratch
   an equivalent _make_suite.mll_ to replace the Ruby script. (=qtest1)
 * Jan 19, 2012: Vincent Hugot writes from scratch a new version, with a lot
   of new features. Syntax changes a bit.  (=qtest2)
 * Oct 21, 2012: qtest2 moves to its own repository.
 * Sept. 2015: Simon Cruanes contributes a significant improvement of the random generation process.
 * March. 2016: Simon Cruanes integrates `qcheck` with `qtest`
 * Dec. 2016: `qcheck` and `qtest` are split apart again
 * Feb. 2018: renaming the repository to `qtest` again

Over time, the various versions of qtest have
received https://github.com/vincent-hugot/qtest/graphs/contributors[contributions] by:
Eric Norige, Gabriel Scherer, Cedric Cellier, Valentin Gatien-Baron, Max Mouratov,
and Simon Cruanes.

[[introduction]]
== Introduction: What Is QTest?

In a nutshell, qtest is a small program which reads `.ml` and `.mli` source
files and extracts inline unit tests from them. It is used internally by
the http://batteries.forge.ocamlcore.org[OCaml Batteries] project,
and is shipped with it as of version 2.0, but it does not
depend on it and can be compiled and used independently.

Browse its code in the
https://github.com/ocaml-batteries-team/batteries-included/tree/master/qtest[Github Repository].

[[using-a-quick-simple-example]]
== Using qtest: a Quick, Simple Example

Say that you have a file `foo.ml`, which contains the implementation of
your new, shiny function `foo`.

[source,OCaml]
--------------------------------------
let rec foo x0 f = function
  | [] -> 0 | x::xs -> f x (foo x0 f xs)
--------------------------------------

Maybe you don’t feel confident about that code; or maybe you do, but you
know that the function might be re-implemented less trivially in the
future and want to prevent potential regressions. Or maybe you simply
think unit tests are good practice anyway. In either case, you feel that
building a separate test suite for this would be overkill. Using qtest,
you can immediately put simple unit tests in comments near `foo`, for
instance:

[source,OCaml]
---------------------------
(*$T foo
  foo  0 ( + ) [1;2;3] = 6
  foo  0 ( * ) [1;2;3] = 0
  foo  1 ( * ) [4;5]   = 20
  foo 12 ( + ) []      = 12
*)
---------------------------

the syntax is simple: `(*$` introduces a qtest "pragma", such as `T`
in this case. `T` is by far the most common and represents a "simple"
unit test. `T` expects a "header", which is most of the time simply
the name of the function under test, here `foo`. Following that, each
line is a "statement", which must evaluate to `true` for the test to
pass. Furthermore, `foo` must appear in each statement.

Now, in order to execute those tests, you need to extract them; this is
done with the qtest executable. The command

------------------------------------------------------
$ qtest -o footest.ml extract foo.ml
Target file: `footest.ml'. Extraction : `foo.ml' Done.
------------------------------------------------------

will create a file `footest.ml`; it’s not terribly human-readable, but
you can see that it contains your tests as well as some
http://ounit.forge.ocamlcore.org[OUnit]
boilerplate. Now you need to compile the tests, for instance with
`ocamlbuild`, and assuming OUnit was installed for `ocamlfind`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ocamlbuild -cflags -warn-error,+26 -use-ocamlfind -package oUnit \
    footest.native
Finished, 10 targets (1 cached) in 00:00:00.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the `-cflags -warn-error,+26` is not indispensable but
strongly recommended. Its function will be explained in more detail in
the more technical sections of this documentation, but roughly it makes
sure that if you write a test for `foo`, via `(*$T foo` for instance,
then `foo` is _actually_ tested by each statement – the tests won’t
compile if not.

*Important note:* in order for this to work, `ocamlbuild` must know
where to find `foo.ml`; if `footest.ml` is not in the same directory,
you must make provisions to that effect. If `foo.ml` needs some specific
flags in order to compile, they must also be passed.

Now there only remains to run the tests:

......
$ ./footest.native
..FF
==============================================================================
Failure: qtest:0:foo:3:foo.ml:10

OUnit: foo.ml:10::>  foo 12 ( + ) [] = 12
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==============================================================================
Failure: qtest:0:foo:2:foo.ml:9

OUnit: foo.ml:9::>  foo 1 ( * ) [4;5] = 20
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran: 4 tests in: 0.00 seconds.
FAILED: Cases: 4 Tried: 4 Errors: 0 Failures: 2 Skip:0 Todo:0
......

Oops, something’s wrong… either the tests are incorrect or `foo` is.
Finding and fixing the problem is left as an exercise for the reader.
When this is done, you get the expected

------------------------------
$ ./footest.native
....
Ran: 4 tests in: 0.00 seconds.
------------------------------

TIP: those steps are easy to automate, for instance with a small shell
script:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
set -e # stop on first error
qtest -o footest.ml extract foo.ml
ocamlbuild -cflags -warn-error,+26 -use-ocamlfind -package oUnit footest.native
./footest.native
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== More qtest Pragmas

[[different-kinds-of-tests]]
=== Different Kinds of Tests

[[simple-tests-for-test]]
==== Simple Tests: `T` for "Test"

The most common kind of tests is the simple test, an example of which is
given above. It is of the form

[source,OCaml]
-------------
(*$T <header>
  <statement>
  ...
*)
-------------

where each _statement_ must be a boolean OCaml expression involving the
function (or functions, as we will see when we study headers) referenced
in the __header__. The overall test is considered successful if each
_statement_ evaluates to `true`. Note that the "close comment" `*)`
must appear on a line of its own.

*Tip:* if a statement is a bit too long to fit on one line, if can be
broken using a backslash (`\`), immediately followed by the carriage
return. This also applies to randomised tests.

[[equality-tests]]
==== Equality Tests: `=`

The vast majority of test cases tend to involve the equality of two
expressions; using simple tests, one would write something like:

[source,OCaml]
-----------------------------------------
(*$T foo
  foo 1 ( * ) [4;5] = foo 3 ( * ) [1;5;2]
*)
-----------------------------------------

While this certainly works, the failure report for such a test does not
convey any useful information besides the simple fact that the test
failed. Wouldn’t it be nice if the report also mentioned the values of
the left-hand side and the right-hand side ? Yes it would, and
specialised equality tests provide such functionality, at the cost of a
little bit of boilerplate code. The bare syntax is:

[source,OCaml]
-------------
(*$= <header>
  <lhs> <rhs>
  ...
*)
-------------

However, used bare, an equality test will not provide much more
information than a simple test: just a laconic "not equal". In order
for the values to be printed, a "value printer" must be specified for
the test. A printer is a function of type
`'a -> string`, where `'a` is
the type of the expressions on both side of the equality. To pass the
printer to the test, we use _parameter injection_ (cf. Section
<<parameter-injection>>); equality tests have an optional argument `printer` for
this purpose. In our example, we have
`'a = int`, so the test becomes simply:

[source,OCaml]
-------------------------------------------
(*$= foo & ~printer:string_of_int
  (foo 1 ( * ) [4;5]) (foo 3 ( * ) [1;5;2])
*)
-------------------------------------------

The failure report will now be more explicit, saying
`expected: 20 but got: 30`.

[[randomized-tests-for-quickcheck]]
==== Randomized Tests: `Q` for "Quickcheck"

Quickcheck is a small library useful for randomized unit tests. Using it
is a bit more complex, but much more rewarding than simple tests.

[source,OCaml]
----------------------------------------------------
(*$Q <header>
  <generator> (fun <generated value> -> <statement>)
  ...
*)
----------------------------------------------------

Let us dive into an example straight-away:

[source,OCaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*$Q foo
  Q.small_int (fun i-> foo i (+) [1;2;3] = List.fold_left (+) i [1;2;3])
*)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Quickcheck module is accessible simply as _Q_ within inline tests;
`small_int` is a generator, yielding a random, small integer. When the
test is run, each statement will be evaluated for a large number of
random values – 100 by default. Running this test for the
above definition of foo catches the mistake easily:

--------------------------------------------------------
law foo.ml:14::>  Q.small_int (fun i-> foo i (+) [1;2;3]
    = List.fold_left (+) i [1;2;3])
failed for 2
--------------------------------------------------------

Note that the random value for which the test failed is provided by the
error message – here it is 2. It is also possible to generate several
random values simultaneously using tuples. For instance

[source,OCaml]
----------------------------------------------------
(Q.pair Q.small_int (Q.list Q.small_int)) \
  (fun (i,l)-> foo i (+) l = List.fold_left (+) i l)
----------------------------------------------------

will generate both an integer and a list of small integers randomly. A
failure will then look like

-----------------------------------------------------------
law foo.ml:15::>  (Q.pair Q.small_int (Q.list Q.small_int))
    (fun (i,l)-> foo i (+) l = List.fold_left (+) i l)
failed for (727, [4; 3; 6; 1; 788; 49])
-----------------------------------------------------------

A generator such as `Q.pair Q.small_int Q.printable_string` is actually a value of type
`'a Q.arbitrary` (in this particular case, `(int * string) arbitrary`).
It combines a random generation function (`'a Q.Gen.t`),
and optional printing, shrinking and size functions that are used to
display counter-examples and minimize their size. It is possible, as
explained below, to define one's own `'a arbitrary` values, for instance
for custom types.

*Available Generators:*

Simple generators::
`unit`, `bool`, `float`, `pos_float`, `neg_float`, `int`, `int32`,
`int64`, `pos_int`, `small_int`, `neg_int`, `char`, `printable_char`,
`numeral_char`, `string`, `printable_string`, `numeral_string`
Structure generators::
`list` and `array`. They take one generator as their argument. For
instance `(Q.list Q.neg_int)` is a generator of lists of (uniformly
taken) negative integers.
Tuple generators::
`pair` and `triple` are respectively binary and ternary. See above for
an example of `pair`.
Size-directed generators::
`string`, `numeral_string`, `printable_string`, `list` and `array` all
have `*_of_size` variants that take the size of the structure as their
first argument.

See the https://c-cube.github.io/qcheck/[online documentation of QCheck]
for more details.

*Tips:*

Duplicate Elements in Lists::
When generating lists, avoid
`Q.list Q.int` unless you have a good reason to do so. The reason is
that, given the size of the `Q.int` space, you are unlikely to generate
any duplicate elements. If you wish to test your function’s behaviour
with duplicates, prefer `Q.list Q.small_int`.
Filtering Inputs::
Rando, inputs can be filtered for a _precondition_ by stating a property
`f ==> g`. An input `x` will be tested for the property `g` only if `f x` holds,
otherwise it is discarded and a new input is generated. The total number of
inputs generated can be capped using the `~max_gen:int` parameter (it should
be bigger than `~count`). The system will try to make `count` tests, but stops
after `max_gen` inputs are generated to avoid looping forever if acceptable
inputs are too rare.
Changing Number of Tests::
If you want a specific test to execute
each of its statements a specific number of times (deviating from the
default of 100), you can specify it explicitly through
_parameter injection_ (cf. Section <<parameter-injection>>) using the `count` :
argument.
Getting a Better Counterexample::
By default, a random test stops as
soon as one of its generated values yields a failure. This first failure
value is probably not the best possible counterexample. You can _force_
qtest to generate and test all `count` random values regardless, and to
display the value which is smallest with respect to a certain measure
which you define. To this end, it suffices to use parameter injection to
pass argument `small : 'a -> 'b`, where
`'a` is the type of generated values and
`'b` is any totally ordered set (wrt. `<`).
Typically you will take `'b = int` or `'b = float`. Example:
+
[source,OCaml]
--------------------------------------------------------
let fuz x = x
let rec flu = function
  | [] -> []
  | x :: l -> if List.mem x l then flu l else x :: flu l

(*$Q fuz; flu & ~small:List.length
  (Q.list Q.small_int) (fun x -> fuz x = flu x)
*)
--------------------------------------------------------
+
The meaning of `~small:List.length` is therefore simply:
    "choose the shortest list". For very complicated cases, you can simultaneously
increase `count` to yield an even higher-quality counterexample.

Shrinking::
A parameter `shrink: ('a -> 'a Q.Iter.t)` can be provided along with a random
generator. `'a Q.Iter.t` is an iterator on values of type `'a`. `shrink x`
should iterate on a set of values that are smaller than `x` (for instance,
if `x: int list`, `shrink x` will remove each element of the list).
If a generator (of type `'a arbitrary`) defines a shrink function, then
whenever a counter-example is found for a property, the
counter-example will be shrunk recursively as long as it continues refuting
the property; this allows to find smaller and simpler counter-examples.
However, shrinking can be slow.
A parameter `~max_fail:int` can be given to the test
by writing `(*$Q & ~max_fail:5` to limit the number of counter-examples
to find, in case shrinking them is too slow.
+
The module `Q.Shrink` can be used to combine shrinking functions.
+
Example: the false property `(Q.list Q.int) (fun l -> not (List.mem 5 l))`
might be falsified by the counter-example `[1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8]`. By recursively
shrinking the value (trying to remove elements one by one) the minimal
counter-example `[5]` will be found and displayed.

Raw Random Tests::
Using `(*$QR`, similar to the raw unit test `(*$R`, it is possible to
write a random test on multiple lines without the trailing `\`
characters.
+
[source,OCaml]
-----------------------------------------------------
(*$QR foo
  Q.small_int
    (fun i->
      foo i (+) [1;2;3] = List.fold_left (+) i [1;2;3]
    )
*)
-----------------------------------------------------
+
The `(*$QR` block needs to contain exactly two values:

    Random Generator::: of type `'a Quickcheck.arbitrary`
    Property to test::: of type `'a -> bool`

Custom Generators::
For types that are not lists of integers or strings, it can be useful to define
one's own `'a arbitrary` instance for the type. The function to use is
`Q.make`, it takes a `'a Q.Gen.t` random generator, and optional arguments
  * `~shrink:('a -> 'a Iter.t)` to define how to shrink counter-examples
  * `~small:('a -> 'b)` (where `'b` is ordered) to select small counter-examples
  * `~print:('a -> string)` to print counter-examples
  * `~collect:('a -> string)` maps inputs to a `string` descriptor and
    counts how many values belong to each descriptor, for statistics.
+
Some generators are already defined in `Q.Gen`. Gabriel Scherer's
https://github.com/gasche/random-generator[random-generator library] is also
a good basis for more advanced generators.
+
Printers can be defined using `Q.Print`, shrinkers using `Q.Shrink`.

[[raw-ounit-tests-for-raw]]
==== Raw OUnit Tests: `R` for "Raw"

When more specialised test pragmas are too restrictive, for instance if
the test is too complex to reasonably fit on one line, then one can use
raw OUnit tests.

[source,OCaml]
---------------------
(*$R <header>
  <raw oUnit test>...
  ...
*)
---------------------

Here is a small example, with two tests stringed together:

[source,OCaml]
--------------------------------------------------------
(*$R foo
  let thing = foo  1 ( * )
  and li = [4;5] in
  assert_bool "something_witty" (thing li = 20);
  assert_bool "something_wittier" (foo 12 ( + ) [] = 12)
*)
--------------------------------------------------------

Note that if the first assertion fails, the second will not be executed;
so stringing two assertions in that mode is different in that respect
from doing so under a `T` pragma, for instance.

That said, raw tests should only be used as a last resort; for instance
you don’t automatically get the source file and line number when the
test fails. If `T` and `Q` do not satisfy your needs, then it is
_probably_ a hint that the test is a bit complex and, maybe, belongs in
a separate test suite rather than in the middle of the source code.

[[exception-throwing-tests-for-exception]]
==== Exception-Throwing Tests: `E` for "Exception"

… not implemented yet…

The current usage is to use `(*$T` and the following pattern for
function `foo` and exception `Bar`:

[source,OCaml]
------------------------------------------
try ignore (foo x); false with Bar -> true
------------------------------------------

If your project uses Batteries and no pattern-matching is needed, then
you can also use the following, sexier pattern:

[source,OCaml]
----------------------------------
Result.(catch foo x |> is_exn Bar)
----------------------------------

[[manipulation-pragmas]]
== Manipulation Pragmas

Not all qtest pragmas directly translate into tests; for non-trivial
projects, sometimes a little boilerplate code is needed in order to set
the tests up properly. The pragmas which do this are collectively called
"manipulation pragmas"; they are described in the next section.

[[opening-modules-open-pragma-and-option]]
=== Opening Modules: _open_ Pragma `<...>` and `--preamble` Option

The tests should have access to the same values as the code under test;
however the generated code for `foo.ml` does not actually live inside
that file. Therefore some effort must occasionally be made to
synchronise the code’s environment with the tests’. There are three main
usecases where you might want to open modules for tests:

Project-Wide Global Open::
It may happen that _every single file_ in your project opens a given
module. This is the case for Batteries, for instance, where every module
opens `Batteries`. In that case simply use the `–preamble` switch. For
instance,
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------
qtest --preamble "open Batteries;;"  extract mod1.ml mod2.ml ... modN.ml
------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
Note that you could insert arbitrary code using this switch.
c
Global Open in a File::
Now, let’s say that `foo.ml` opens `Bar` and `Baz`; you want the tests
in `foo.ml` to open them as well. Then you can use the _open_ pragma in
its _global_ form:
+
-----------------
(*$< Bar, Baz >*)
-----------------
+
The modules will be open for every test in the same `.ml` file, and
following the pragma. However, in our example, you will have a
duplication of code between the "open" directives of `foo.ml`, and the
_open_ pragma of qtest, like so:
+
---------------------
open Bar;; open Baz;;
(*$< Bar, Baz >*)
---------------------
+
It might therefore be more convenient to use the _code injection_ pragma
(see next section) for that purpose, so you would write instead:
+
-----------------------------------
(*${*) open Bar;; open Baz;; (*$}*)
-----------------------------------
+
The code between that special markup will simply be duplicated into the
tests. The two methods are equivalent, and the second one is
recommended, because it reduces the chances of an impedance mismatch
between modules open for `foo.ml` and its tests. Therefore, the global
form of the _open_ pragma should preferentially be reserved for cases
where you _want_ such a mismatch. For instance, if you have special
modules useful for tests but useless for the main code, you can easily
open then for the tests alone using the pragma.

Local Open for a Submodule::
Let’s say we have the following `foo.ml`:
+
[source,OCaml]
-------------------------
let outer x = <something>

module Submod = struct
  let inner y = 2*x
  (*$T inner
    inner 2 = 4
  *)
end
-------------------------
+
That seems natural enough… but it won’t work, because qtest is not
actually aware that the test is "inside" Submod (and making it aware
of that would be very problematic). In fact, so long as you use only
test pragmas (ie. no manipulation pragma at all), the positions and even
the order of the tests – respective to definitions or to each other –
are unimportant, because the tests do not actually live in `foo.ml`. So
we need to open Submod manually, using the _local_ form of the _open_
pragma:
+
[source,OCaml]
-------------------------------------
module Submod = struct (*$< Submod *)
  let inner y = 2*x
  (*$T inner
    inner 2 = 4
  *)
end (*$>*)
-------------------------------------
+
Notice that the `<...>` have simply been split in two, compared to the
global form. The effect of that construct is that Submod will be open
for every test between `(*$< Submod *)` and `(*$>*)`. Of course, you
_could_ also forgo that method entirely and do this:
+
[source,OCaml]
----------------------
module Submod = struct
  let inner y = 2*x
  (*$T &
    Submod.inner 2 = 4
  *)
end
----------------------
+
… but it is impractical and you are _forced_ to use an empty header
because qualified names are not acceptable as headers. The first method
is therefore _strongly_ recommended.

[[code-injection-pragma]]
=== Code Injection Pragma:

TODO: ocamldoc comments that define unit tests from the offered examples

[[technical-considerations-and-other-details]]
== Technical Considerations and Other Details

What has been said above should suffice to cover at least 90% of
use-cases for qtest. This section concerns itself with the remaining
10%.

[[function-coverage]]
=== Function Coverage

The headers of a test are not just there for decoration; three
properties are enforced when a test, say, `(*$X foo` is compiled, where
`X` is `T`, `R`, `Q`, `QR`,… :

* `foo` exists; that is to say, it is defined in the scope of the module
where the testappears – though one can play with pragmas to relax this
condition somewhat. At the very least, it has to be defined
__somewhere__. Failure to conform results in an
`Error: Unbound value foo`.
* `foo` is referenced in _each statement_ of the test: for `T` and `Q`,
that means "each line". For `R`, that means "once somewhere in the
test’s body". Failure to conform results in a
`Warning 26: unused variable foo`, which will be treated as an error if
`-warn-error +26` is passed to the compiler. It goes without saying that
this is warmly recommended.
* the test possesses at least one statement.

Those two conditions put together offer a strong guarantee that, if a
function is referenced in a test header, then it is actually tested at
least once. The list of functions referenced in the headers of extracted
tests is written by qtest into `qtest.targets.log`. Each line is of the
form

------------------
foo.ml   42    foo
------------------

where `foo.ml` is the file in which the test appears, as passed to
`extract`, and `42` is the line number where the test pragma appears in
`foo.ml`. Note that a same function can be listed several times for the
same source file, if several tests involve it (say, two times if it has
both a simple test and a random one). The exact number of statements
involving `foo` in each test is currently not taken into account in the
logs.

[[headers-and-metaheaders]]
=== Headers and Metaheaders

The informal definition of headers given in the above was actually a
simplification. In this section we explore two syntaxes available for
headers.

[[aliases]]
==== Aliases

Some functions have exceedingly long names. Case in point :

[source,OCaml]
---------------------------------------------------
let rec pretentious_drivel x0 f = function
  | [] -> x0
  | x::xs -> pretentious_drivel (f x x0) f xs
---------------------------------------------------

[source,OCaml]
--------------------------------------------------
(*$T pretentious_drivel
  pretentious_drivel 1 (+) [4;5] = foo 1 (+) [4;5]
  ... pretentious_drivel of this and that...
*)
--------------------------------------------------

The constraint that each statement must fit on one line does not play
well with very long function names. Furthermore, you _known_ which
function is being tested, it’s right there is the header; no need to
repeat it a dozen times. Instead, you can define an __alias__, and write
equivalently:

[source,OCaml]
---------------------------------
(*$T pretentious_drivel as x
  x 1 (+) [4;5] = foo 1 (+) [4;5]
  ... x of this and that...
*)
---------------------------------

…thus saving many keystrokes, thereby contributing to the
preservation of the environment. More seriously, aliases have uses
beyond just saving a few keystrokes, as we will see in the next
sections.

[[mutually-tested-functions]]
==== Mutually Tested Functions

Most of the time, a test only pertains to one function. There are times,
however, when one wishes to test two functions – or more – at the same
time. For instance

[source,OCaml]
---------------------------------
let rec even = function 0 -> true
  | n -> odd (pred n)
and odd = function 0 -> false
  | n -> even (pred n)
---------------------------------

Let us say that we have the following test:

[source,OCaml]
----------------------------------------------------
(*$Q <header>
  Q.small_int (fun n-> odd (abs n+3) = even (abs n))
*)
----------------------------------------------------

It involves both `even` and `odd`. That question is: "what is a proper
header for this test?" One could simply put "even", and thus it would
be referenced as being tested in the logs, but `odd` would not, which is
unfair. Putting "odd" is symmetrically unfair. The solution is to put
both, separated by a semi-colon:

[source,OCaml]
--------------
(*$Q even; odd
--------------

That way _both_ functions are referenced in the logs:

-----------------------
    foo.ml   37    even
    foo.ml   37    odd
-----------------------

and of course the compiler enforces that both of them are actually
referenced in each statement of the test. Of course, each of them can be
written under alias, in which case the header could be
`even as x; odd as y`.

[[testing-functions-by-the-dozen]]
==== Testing Functions by the Dozen

Let us come back to our functions `foo` (after correction) and
`pretentious_drivel`, as defined above.

[source,OCaml]
---------------------------------------------------
let rec foo x0 f = function
  | [] -> x0
  | x::xs -> f x (foo x0 f xs)

let rec pretentious_drivel x0 f = function
  | [] -> x0
  | x::xs -> pretentious_drivel (f x x0) f xs
---------------------------------------------------

You will not have failed to notice that they bear more than a passing
resemblance to one another. If you write tests for one, odds are that
the same test could be useful verbatim for the other. This is a very
common case when you have closely related functions, or even several
_implementations_ of the same function, for instance the old, slow,
naïve, trustworthy one and the new, fast, arcane, highly optimised
version you have just written. The typical case is sorting routines, of
which there are many flavours.

For our example, recall that we have the following test for `foo`:

[source,OCaml]
------------------------------------------------------
(*$Q foo
  (Q.pair Q.small_int (Q.list Q.small_int)) \
    (fun (i,l)-> foo i (+) l = List.fold_left (+) i l)
*)
------------------------------------------------------

The same test would apply to `pretentious_drivel`; you could just
copy-and-paste the test and change the header, but it’s not terribly
elegant. Instead, you can just just add the other function to the
header, separating the two by a comma, and defining an alias:

[source,OCaml]
--------------------------------------------------
(*$Q foo, pretentious_drivel as x
  (Q.pair Q.small_int (Q.list Q.small_int)) \
  (fun (i,l)-> x i (+) l = List.fold_left (+) i l)
*)
--------------------------------------------------

This same test will be run once for `x = foo`, and once for
`x = pretentious_drivel`. Actually, you need not define an alias: if the
header is of the form

[source,OCaml]
----------------------------
(*$Q foo, pretentious_drivel
----------------------------

then it is equivalent to

[source,OCaml]
-----------------------------------
(*$Q foo, pretentious_drivel as foo
-----------------------------------

so you do not need to alter the body of the test if you subsequently add
new functions. A header which combines more than one "version" of a
function in this way is called a __metaheader__.

[[metaheaders-unleashed]]
==== Metaheaders Unleashed

All the constructs above can be combined without constraints: the
grammar is as follows:

-----------------------------------------------------
    Metaheader  ::=   Binding {";" Binding}
    Binding     ::=   Functions [ "as" ID ]
    Functions   ::=   ID {"," ID}
    ID          ::=   (*OCaml lower-case identifier*)
-----------------------------------------------------

[[parameter-injection]]
==== Header Parameters Injection

Use `(*$inject foo *)` to inject the piece of code `foo` at the
beginning of this module’s tests. This is useful, for instance, to
define frequently used random generators, or printers, or to instantiate
a functor before testing it.

[[warnings-and-exceptions-thrown-by-qtest]]
=== Warnings and Exceptions Thrown by qtest

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fatal error: exception Failure("Unrecognised qtest pragma: ` T foo'")
---------------------------------------------------------------------

You have written something like `(*$ T foo`; there must not be any space
between `(*$` and the pragma.

------------------------------------------------------
Warning: likely qtest syntax error: `(* $T foo'. Done.
------------------------------------------------------

Self-explanatory; if `$` is the first real character of a comment, it’s
likely a mistyped qtest pragma. This is only a warning though.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Fatal error: exception Core.Bad_header_char("M", "Mod.foo")
-----------------------------------------------------------

You have used a qualified name in a header, for instance `(*$T Mod.foo`.
You cannot do that, the name must be unqualified and defined under the
local scope. Furthermore, it must be public, unless you have used
pragmas to deal with private functions.

---------------------------------------------------
Error: Comment not terminated
Fatal error: exception Core.Unterminated_test(_, 0)
---------------------------------------------------

Most probably, you forgot the comment-closing `*)` to close some test.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fatal error: exception Failure("runaway test body terminator: n))*)")
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The comment-closing `*)` must be on a line of its own; or, put another
way, every statement must be ended by a line break.

[[qtest-command-line-options]]
=== qtest Command-Line Options

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ qtest --help

** qtest (qtest)
USAGE: qtest [options] extract <file.mli?>...

OPTIONS:
--output <file.ml>    (-o) def: standard output
  Open or create a file for output; the resulting file will be an OCaml
  source file containing all the tests.

--preamble <string>   (-p) def: empty
  Add code to the tests' preamble; typically this will be an instruction
  of the form 'open Module;;'


--help          Displays this help page and stops
------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[qtest-runtime-options]]
=== qtest Runtime Command-Line Options

Test files generated by qtest also accept command line options, described
by `--help` if needed.

----
$ qtest extract foo.ml -o footest.ml

$ ocamlfind ocamlopt -package qcheck -linkpkg footest.ml -o footest

$ ./footest --help

run qtest suite
-v
-verbose  enable verbose tests
-l
-list     print list of tests (2 lines each). Implies -verbose
-s
-seed     set random seed (to repeat tests)
-help     Display this list of options
--help    Display this list of options

----

Currently the options are:

- `--verbose`: verbose quick check tests (print statistics, etc.)
- `--list`: print a list of tests as they are executed.
- `--seed`: force the choice of a random seed. When random tests start, the
  random seed used by the random generators is displayed; later, providing
  the same seed with `--seed <s>` will repeat the same tests.

== A few tricks

A few useful tricks when writing inline tests:

- if possible, favor `(*$= a b *)` over `(*$T (a = b) *)`, because the former
  makes it possible to add a printer (with `& ~printer:some_printer`) in
  case the two values are not equal
- random tests are useful to check general properties, or compare a complex-but-efficient
  implementation to a (possibly naive) reference implementation. For
  instance, if we had implemented a fancy sort function `my_sort` on lists, we
  could compare it to the stdlib's `List.sort`:
+
[source,OCaml]
----
(*$Q
  Q.(list int) (fun l -> \
    my_sort compare l = List.sort compare l)
*)
----
- to factor some code that is useful in tests, but should not appear in the
  module (for instance, printers or generators for running complex tests),
  you can use `(*$inject ... *)` somewhere in the `.ml` file:
+
[source,OCaml]
----
type foo = { a : int; b : string }

(*$inject
  let pp_foo f = Printf.sprintf "foo{a=%d, b=%s}" f.a f.b
*)

(*$= & ~printer:pp_foo
  {a=0; b="b1"} {a=42; b="b2"}
*)
----
+
here, the test can use a custom printer defined above (and it needs it,
for it will fail badly).

=== Using qtest with dune

The simplest way is to use `(inline_tests (backend qtest.lib))` in a `library`
statement:

[source]
----
(library
  (name foo)
  (inline_tests (backend qtest.lib)))
----

And then `dune runtest` should automatically find inline tests in the
library's modules.

For better control, a rule can be used (adapt to fit your needs):

----
(rule
  (targets run_qtest.ml)
  (deps (source_tree src))
  ; here is where you need to tell qtest what files to consider
  (action (with-stdout-to %{targets} 
          (run qtest extract src/foo1.ml src/foo2.ml))))

(executable
  (name run_qtest)
  (modules run_qtest)
  ; disable some warnings in qtests
  (flags :standard -warn-error -a -w -33-35-27-39)
  (libraries qcheck))

(rule
  (alias    runtest)
  (action  (run ./run_qtest.exe)))

----

Since version 2.8 `dune` has https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tests.html?highlight=deps#passing-special-arguments-to-the-test-runner[a simpler way to customize the test program]; the following has the same effect:
[source]
----
(library
  (name foo)
  (inline_tests
       (executable (flags :standard -warn-error -a -w -33-35-27-39))
       (backend qtest.lib)))
----

On the more, for a better output, you may use `dune runtest -j 1 --no-buffer` (see this https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/3463#issuecomment-625268701[issue comment] in https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/3463[`dune` #3463 issue]).

=== Using qtest with OCamlbuild

The following snippet, added to `myocamlbuild.ml`, will use `qtest`
to extract `foo_tests.ml` from `foo.ml` for any module `foo`.

[source,OCaml]
----
open Ocamlbuild_plugin;;

rule "qtest extract"
  ~prod:"%_tests.ml"
  ~deps:["%.ml"]
  (fun env build ->
   Cmd(S[A"qtest"; A"extract"; A"-o"; P(env "%_tests.ml");
         P(env "%.ml")]))
----

It is also possible to make a single `all_tests.ml` file from many modules, if
they are listed in `all_tests.qtestpack` file (similar to `.mllib`):

[source,OCaml]
----
open Ocamlbuild_plugin;;

let import_qtestpack build packfile =
  let tags1 = tags_of_pathname packfile in
  let files = string_list_of_file packfile in
  let include_dirs = Pathname.include_dirs_of (Pathname.dirname packfile) in
  let files_alternatives =
    List.map begin fun module_name ->
      expand_module include_dirs module_name ["ml"; "mli"]
    end files
  in
  let files = List.map Outcome.good (build files_alternatives) in
  let tags2 =
    List.fold_right
      (fun file -> Tags.union (tags_of_pathname file))
      files tags1
  in
  (tags2, files)

let qtest_many target packfile env build =
  let packfile = env packfile and target = env target in
  let tags, files = import_qtestpack build packfile in
  Cmd(S[A "qtest";
        A "extract"; T tags;
        A "-o"; A target; Command.atomize_paths files]);;

rule "ocaml: modular qtest (qtestpack)"
  ~prods:["%.ml"]
  ~deps:["%.qtestpack"]
  ~doc:"Qtest supports building a test module by extracting cases
	directly from several composing several .ml{,i} files together.  \
	To use that feature with ocamlbuild, you should create a .qtestpack \
	file with the same syntax as .mllib or .mlpack files: \
	a whitespace-separated list of the capitalized module names \
	of the .ml{,i} files you want to combine together."
  (qtest_many "%.ml" "%.qtestpack");
----

For instance, `run_tests.qtestpack` might contain

----
src/Foo
src/sub/Bar
----

and the target would be

[source,Sh]
----
ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind -package qcheck \
	-I src -I src/sub run_tests.native
----
